The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nAngular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:\nPrzykład :ng generate component component-nameFor a complete list of available schematics (such as components, directives, or pipes), run:\nPrzykład :ng generate --helpBuilding\nTo build the project run:\nPrzykład :ng buildThis will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the dist/ directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.\nRunning unit tests\nTo execute unit tests with the Karma test runner, use the following command:\nPrzykład :ng testRunning end-to-end tests\nFor end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:\nPrzykład :ng e2eAngular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.\nAdditional Resources\nFor more information on using the Angular CLI, including detailed command references, visit the Angular CLI Overview and Command
